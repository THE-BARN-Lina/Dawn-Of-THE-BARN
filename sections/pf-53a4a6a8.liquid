When Ralf visited El Salvador in February, and he saw we have a system of resting our natural coffees in a type of wooden box. This was sort of by accident, the natural coffees (like our Himalaya Pineapple for the barn) take a long time to dry. When I say 23 days that's an average, but it might take longer. Sometimes I'm getting 100 or 60 bags of cherry and I don't have a place to put them, so I have to move them temporarily to these boxes. You can leave them there for 4-6 days, which opens up some space for us. After this we take the cherries that are ready down to the patio where it's hotter, which is basically where we finish the drying. It's a system Ralf I think enjoyed watching because in the end it's all hand-crafted, it's very slow. <br><br>I think we have been doing naturals now for close to nine or 10 years, so the experience that we have - it shows in the final product. I was talking with other producers from places like Nicaragua and Colombia today who are visiting for WoC also - we all said the naturals are like an animal, a whole different animal. They can be tricky because there's so much to them so there is a big risk. Because remember, if a natural doesn't come out the right way - I can't sell it. If I do a washed coffee, and it's not up to the par of let's say, The Barn, I can sell it to somebody else - maybe not at as good a price as The Barn, but still an ok price. But if you have a defective lot, a natural that you tried to make super good but it isn't, then no ones gonna buy it. I spoke to Boyce about it today, and we have the same problems even though he is in Kenya and I'm in El Salvador. <br><br>It is a risk, but that is also where the opportunity lies. I'm very happy to have my coffees here in The Barn because I just love the way Ralf and The Barn treats the roasting, it's amazing. So to be a part of this, and to be a big part of it, it's a partnership that I hope will go on for a very long time.<br></span></p><p class="sc-hGnimi ljiQdr pf-99_ pf-hide" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-bjeSbO dNWPds pf-101_">Yes!
