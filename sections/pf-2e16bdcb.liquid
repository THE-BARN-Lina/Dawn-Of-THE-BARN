Growing in shade allows cherries to ripen slowly and to produce high sugar levels. We have exclusivity to Gatame, which sits at the highest elevation of Dambi Uddo at 2145m. All coffees grown here are ‘garden coffees’, which means they grow wild in the forest that flourishes on the farm and are fully organic.<br><br>Guji Highland benefits from great rain patterns, resulting in consistently good harvests. The first rain is around the end of February until June, with a second rain from September to October.&nbsp;<br></span></p></div></div><div class="pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--6 pf-c-md--6 pf-c-lg--6" style="padding: 15px;"><div class="pf-0c04b039 sc-cbkKFq bTgDOc" data-pf-type="Column"></div></div></div><div class="pf-190c7837 pf-r pf-r-eh sc-fYiAbW bgvpaP" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--6 pf-c-md--6 pf-c-lg--6" style="padding: 15px;"><div class="pf-255fc36a sc-cbkKFq bTgDOc" data-pf-type="Column"></div></div><div class="pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--6 pf-c-md--6 pf-c-lg--6" style="padding: 15px;"><div class="pf-ffc885ac sc-cbkKFq bTgDOc" data-pf-type="Column"><p class="pf-9e8b6898 sc-jzgbtB fWpeJL" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span class="pf-e3449bad sc-itybZL ihLHML" data-pf-type="Text">Dambi Uddo is owned by Wodessa Yachisi, who is currently building a new drying station with 120 new drying beds.

Gera site is not easy to reach. We have taken motorcyles on our visit last year. Once coffees are dried and ready for the dry mill, they are transported back to the road by horses.

After THE BARN committed to buy from him at a high price, Mohamed was able to invest in better picking and processing. As a result, he produced 60% of grade ones this season which is a huge jump for a farm. <br><br>Naturals dry for around 18 to 25 days. Honeys need only 10 to 14 days, which is why Mohamed Ali starting producing honeys. They also taste delicious! <br><br>The coffees stay in parchment for 30-45 days, after which they are sent to be cleaned at the dry mill. Both site purchased a de-huller to produce honeys.

In the mean time, we feature Edido and the Dambi Uddo that have already been released. Both were roasted for espresso, but also taste absolutely delicious as a filter thanks to their intense flavour notes and our light roast style.<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--12 pf-c-md--12 pf-c-lg--12" style="padding: 15px;"><div class="pf-fd6db0ac sc-cbkKFq bTgDOc" data-pf-type="Column"><h4 mode="view" class="pf-481ea77f sc-iQNlJl RVbtq" data-pf-type="Heading"><span class="pf-a2ed209f sc-itybZL ihLHML" data-pf-type="Text">EDIDO ESPRESSO<br></span></h4><h4 mode="view" class="pf-bb08b6a6 sc-iQNlJl RVbtq" data-pf-type="Heading"><span class="pf-68b0d9df sc-itybZL ihLHML" data-pf-type="Text"><a href="https://thebarn.de/collections/beans/products/edido" target="_self">AVAILABLE NOW</a><br></span></h4><div class="pf-31dfb7d5 pagefly__table--basic pf-lg--hidden pf-md--hidden pf-sm--hidden sc-jbKcbu hFCISQ" data-pf-type="Table"><table><tbody><tr><td data-cell-id="A1" class="A1"><span>Producer: <br>Various Smallholders&nbsp;<br></span></td><td data-cell-id="B1" class="B1"><span>Region: <br>Edido</span></td></tr><tr><td data-cell-id="A2" class="A2"><span>Coffee Region: <br>Yirgacheffe&nbsp;</span></td><td data-cell-id="B2" class="B2"><span>Elevation: <br>1850–1880 masl<br></span></td></tr><tr><td data-cell-id="A3" class="A3"><span>Farm Size: <br>&gt; 1 hectare&nbsp;</span></td><td data-cell-id="B3" class="B3"><span>Processes: <br>Washed</span></td></tr><tr><td data-cell-id="A4" class="A4"><span>Main Varietals:<br>Typica, Mixed Heirloom</span></td><td data-cell-id="B4" class="B4"><span>Harvest: <br>Nov-Jan<br></span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="pf-3ac08410 pagefly__table--basic pf-xs--hidden sc-jbKcbu hFCISQ" data-pf-type="Table"><table><tbody><tr><td data-cell-id="A1" class="A1"><span>Producer: Various Smallholders</span></td><td data-cell-id="B1" class="B1"><span>Region: Edido</span></td><td data-cell-id="C1" class="C1"><span>Region: Yirgacheffe</span></td><td data-cell-id="D1" class="D1"><span>Elevation:&nbsp; 1850–1880 masl</span></td></tr><tr><td data-cell-id="A2" class="A2"><span>Farm Size: &gt; 1 hectare</span></td><td data-cell-id="B2" class="B2"><span>Processes: Washed</span></td><td data-cell-id="C2" class="C2"><span>Main Varietals: Typica, Mixed Heirloom</span></td><td data-cell-id="D2" class="D2"><span>Harvest: Nov-Jan</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="pf-6999a658 pf-r pf-r-eh sc-fYiAbW bgvpaP" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--6 pf-c-md--6 pf-c-lg--6" style="padding: 15px;"><div class="pf-9abb3d3c sc-cbkKFq bTgDOc" data-pf-type="Column"><p class="pf-559992f7 sc-jzgbtB fWpeJL" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span class="pf-fe79e7d5 sc-itybZL ihLHML" data-pf-type="Text">Ethiopian coffees make for a great summer cup, and this is one of the first two that have already been released this season. Edido only produces one container of washed exportable grade one per year. This coffee is exclusively ours for mainland Europe. <br><br>Edido is the village where this coffee is grown and processed, in a micro-region of Yirgacheffe, Aricha, which is about 8 km from the centre of Yirgacheffe Town. The coffee is picked ripe between November and January, depulped within 12 hours, and washed clean with spring water. The soils in this region are red-brown clay soil, about 1.5 meters deep.<br><br></span></p></div></div><div class="pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--6 pf-c-md--6 pf-c-lg--6" style="padding: 15px;"><div class="pf-5f73a799 sc-cbkKFq bTgDOc" data-pf-type="Column"></div></div></div><div class="pf-40dac8b1 pf-r pf-r-eh sc-fYiAbW bgvpaP" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c pf-c-xs--12 pf-c-sm--6 pf-c-md--6 pf-c-lg--6" style="padding: 15px;"><div class="pf-1eb79e5d sc-cbkKFq bTgDOc" data-pf-type="Column"><p class="pf-91194990 sc-jzgbtB fWpeJL" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span class="pf-e15050a3 sc-itybZL ihLHML" data-pf-type="Text">Edido is a sweet, floral coffee with low acidity. It has tons of flavours ranging from sweet nectarine, honey suckle, jasmine, black tea and milk chocolate. The silky body and a lovely acidity balance out the taste experience of this cup. We roasted Edido for espresso, but it also tastes incredible as a filter brew. Edido is our main washed espresso from Ethiopia this season. <br></span></p><div data-href="https://thebarn.de/collections/beans/products/edido" class="pf-c345bcca sc-iyvyFf gJXqlU" data-pf-type="Block"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>
