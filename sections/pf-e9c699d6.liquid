From our Roastery in Berlin, we are sending fresh roasts to our international café partners (b2b) and coffee subscribers (webshop) to many destinations across the world. Your job is to make sure all the export documents are in place, correct bookings with the best shipping companies and, most importantly, that our coffees arrive quickly and complete at the doorsteps of our customers. They wait excitingly for their coffees - and they need them to run their business. <br><br>

We are looking for a well-organised team player to fit our fantastic office team which is located next to our Roastery at Humboldthain Park in Berlin. You are solution oriented and enjoy working for a company that shares the same values as you. Ideally you bring in experience working with freight forwarders and international logistics systems.<br><br>This is a part-time job, ideal for someone who is looking to work 3-4 hours in the mornings on weekdays only.<br><br>
