Through different varietals, microlots, and processes we are able to offer a vast range of flavours from a single farm - naturally.<br><br>Decaffeinated coffee can be produced using various methods. However this is done, it involves removing elements of the bean, extracting the caffeine, then restoring parts of the bean. This is not a natural process, and tends to strip coffee of much of its flavour. You will often hear decaf described as toast-like, cardboardy, or burnt.<br><br>We have looked at many types of decaffeinated coffee over the years. Some of our wholesale customers offer a decaf option on their menu, and we always felt a need to find the right coffee for them - but as you can imagine, it was hard to find something that had gone through the decaffeination process AND lived up to our philosophy. Whenever we cupped decaf samples in our Quality Control Group, the verdict was always a “noooo that’s not palatable!” or “I cannot score this”.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div><div class="sc-clIzBv iQyrr pf-20_ pf-r pf-r-eh pf-lg-hide pf-md-hide pf-sm-hide" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-bGaVxB jzqjUH pf-21_"></div></div></div></div></div><div data-section-id="pf-35cd" data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-JEhMO cflbly pf-22_ pf-hide"><div style="--cw:1170px" class="sc-igXgud ibzBiD"><div class="sc-clIzBv iQyrr pf-23_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-sm:6;--c-md:6;--c-lg:6"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-bGaVxB jzqjUH pf-24_"><p class="sc-hGnimi ljiQdr pf-25_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-bjeSbO dNWPds pf-27_">On our quest for a lower caffeine solution, we discovered a naturally grown, low-caffeine varietal - Laurina.

Being naturally low in caffeine means that we do not have to alter Laurina in any way. Where decaffeination processes change the chemical composition (and flavour) of the coffee, we can roast this one as is.
