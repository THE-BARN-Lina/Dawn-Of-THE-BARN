So, what are important factors to bear in mind when brewing a delicious cup of coffee? Freshness of coffee beans is certainly an major quality point. <\/p><p>Thats why we print the roast date (plus batch number) on the back of our bean bags. So, when are they are too old? Our guidance is that the best flavour experience is guaranteed in the first 3 months after roast date. <\/p><p>Given that you store the beans correctly (room temperature, sealed bag, no sunlight). Once the bag was opened, we recommend enjoying your beans within 10 days. Having said all this: Light roasted coffee degases slower than dark roasted coffee. Even though you may have surpassed the 3 months, your coffee will still taste a lot better than regular coffee you buy in the supermarkets. <\/p><p>Essentially, it never really goes bad. It just gets weaker in flavour expression. What are other major factors to brew the best cup of coffee: Number one has to be the water. It is more than 95% of the beverage. <\/p><p>Check out our water guide but make sure you have well-filtered water (without any added minerals, if you go for bottled). Secondly, the grind setting is crucial. The more we break the beaan into pieces, the more surface we offer the water for extraction. <\/p><p>Thats why espresso is very fine in grind (you only have around 30 seconds for extraction under high pressure). <\/p><p>And thats why the french press is so coarse (you have 4-5 minutes without any pressure during extraction). Other factors are: agitation and water temperature.      <\/p>",

            "row_content": "<p>Coffee processing happens at farm level. Processing takes place after the ripe coffee cherries are being picked. The two most common processing styles are wet (washed) or dry (natural). <\/p><p>Most of the times, the processing has its roots in the traditional way that coffee is being treated locally and culturally at origin. In Kenya, almost all coffees are being processed wet. <\/p><p>In Ethiopia we have a high ratio of dry processing. Access to water or traditional ways are leading reasons. In wet processing, cherries are being removed from the beans (with mechanical depulpers or water-pressure depulpers). After that, the coffee beans are placed overnight into water tanks. Fermentation takes places under water. After 24 hours (or more, depending on temperature and climate), a second wash may take place. After that, the beans are graded in Grading Channels, followed by further quality sorting and drying on raised African beds. Slow drying is important to ensure intact bean shells (to keep all flavours inside of the beans). Most of our coffee portfolio is now dry or naturally processed. In dry processing, the beans have very little contact with water: literally only at delivery point of the cherries, they are put into water buckets to remove floaters. Floaters are coffee cherries that may look ripe but are not fully ripe. Thats why they float. We remove them because they have lower qualities. The coffee beans are being dried on raised African beds and in cherry. It is important that the cherries are placed in thin layers and they need to be moved regularly. That way, we can create super clean cup profiles. We love naturally processed coffees not only because they are more environmental friendly. But they are also very aromatic, have high sweetness and very balanced acidity. With growing relationships and the quality development of our coffee producers, they engage in modern processing styles, such as anaerobics, honey, carbonic marceration and so on. With those methods, coffee producers have an opportunity to create additional flavour notes that may increase the scoring of the final cup. Innovative methods are also a great way of working around the challenges of climate change. <\/p>",

The varietal tree of arabica coffee keeps spreading: From heirloom and other natural varietals, coffee travelled with colonialism. <\/p><p>From there, new varietals were cross-bred to adjust to soil, increase yield or flavour or to pretect coffee from diseases. Sizes, hardness, density, sweetness, acidity and flavour characteristics vary massively and it is a joy not only to discover different varietals but also to try a varietal on different soil, processing or country of origin. <\/p><p>Some of our more advanced farm partners have varietal gardens where they experiment over many years, what varietal suits best their soil and climate. Based on that, they then look at processing to offer a vast range of flavour profiles, coming from the same farm and soil.    <\/p>",
